# Bikesharing

## Overview

The goal of this project was to analyze bikeshare data from Citibike in New York City to investors interested in launching a bikesharing business in Des Moines, Iowa.

To better understand the feasibility of this idea, we asked the following key questions:

- What types of people use bikesharing?
- How long do people use the bike rentals? Short-term rides or long rides?
- What are the highest-traffic locations?
- What time of day to people use bikesharing?

## Results

### User Description

First, we wanted to understand the population behind the data. Who uses bikesharing? The following charts reveal that the vast majority of riders are male. Additionally, most riders are annual subscribers rather than short-term customers.

### Checkout Times by Users
Next, we wanted to understand how long riders were using the bikes. The following chart lets us know that the majority of users checkout bikes for less than 20 minutes.

### Checkout Times by Gender
In the next visualization, we added gender analysis to our initial checkout time question. We found out that a short checkout time of less than 20 minutes is consistent amongst both male and female riders.

### Start and End Locations
To better understand where users are traveling, we created visualizations highlighting start and end locations. The maps highlight how dense of an urban area users are traveling in.

### Trips by Weekday Per Hour
The following three visualizations help us fine-tune our understanding of when bikesharing is used most. In general, bike usage peaks weekday mornings at 8am and weekday evenings between 5pm and 7pm.

### Trips by Gender (Weekday by Hour)
The most popular bike times are consistent across male and female riders.

### User Trips by Gender by Weekday
The final graph indicates that bikesharing is used most by male annual subscribers on Thursdays.

## Summary
All in all, the primary bikesharing users are male annual subscribers who use the bikes in dense urban areas during weekday commute times. Though the city environment in New York City is different than Des Moines, we can still target male working professionals as our primary potential customer base. 

For further analysis, I would recommend developing visualizations that investigate:
- a chart that shows annual subscribers vs short-term customers, as well as start and end locations. This will allow us to determine if there is a trend in commute time or specific neighborboods for short-term customers and annual subscribers. 
- a chart that displays start and end locations during peak usage times so that we can home in on which neighborhoods users are commuting to and from.
